# Enforcement Policy

> This document explains **how** we respond to Code of Conduct reports.  
> The project follows the [Contributor Covenant v3.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/3/0/code_of_conduct/).

## Reporting

- **Email:** [julienpoirou@protonmail.com](mailto:julienpoirou@protonmail.com)
- **Languages:** English or French
- **Emergency:** If you or someone else is in immediate danger, contact local authorities first.

Please include (as applicable):
- Your contact (GitHub handle/email).
- Where the incident happened (repo/issue/PR/community space).
- Date/time (approximate is fine) and timezone.
- What happened (factual description); link(s) / screenshots if any.
- Who was involved; whether it is ongoing.
- Any context you think is relevant, and what outcome you seek.

Security issues (vulnerabilities) should **not** use this channel; follow the project’s security policy if present, or email the same address with the subject **[SECURITY]**.

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- All project spaces (repositories, issues/PRs, discussions, CI logs, releases).
- Official community spaces (chat/forums) and project-related events.
- External spaces when an individual’s behavior could reasonably impact the project’s community safety or participation.

## Process

1. **Acknowledge**  
   We aim to respond within **72 hours** confirming receipt and outlining next steps.

2. **Triage & Assignment**  
   A maintainer will lead the review. Anyone with a conflict of interest **must recuse** (e.g., being a subject of the report, close personal relationships, employer reporting lines).

3. **Fact-Finding**  
   We review available evidence (links, logs, messages). We may contact involved parties for clarifications. We avoid asking reporters to re-live trauma.

4. **Decision**  
   We apply the guidelines below, considering intent, impact, and history.

5. **Outcome & Communication**  
   We inform the reporter (and, where appropriate, the reported person) of the decision and actions. We will not publish personal details.

6. **Follow-up**  
   We may check in after actions are taken to ensure the situation is resolved and safe.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Possible outcomes (non-exhaustive) – may be combined and scaled:

1. **Correction**  
   - Private or public clarification; request to edit/remove content; reminder of expectations.

2. **Warning**  
   - Formal warning describing the behavior and requested change; notes that further issues will escalate.

3. **Temporary Restrictions**  
   - Time-limited moderation actions (e.g., PR/issue interaction limits, temporary ban from project spaces).

4. **Permanent Restrictions**  
   - Permanent ban from project spaces, removal from organization/team, revocation of roles.

5. **Structural Actions**  
   - Adjusting project processes, moderation tools, or documentation to prevent recurrence.

**Non-retaliation:** Retaliation against anyone reporting or participating in an investigation is a separate violation and will be acted upon.

## Appeals

If you believe a decision was made in error or new information arises, you may request an **appeal** by replying to the decision email within **14 days**, explaining your reasons. A different maintainer (if available) or an external advisor will review.

## Confidentiality & Data Handling

- We treat reports **confidentially**; details are shared only with maintainers who need to know.  
- We keep minimal records (report, decision, actions) for up to **18 months** unless a longer retention is legally required.  
- We may publish **aggregate, anonymized** transparency notes (e.g., number of reports per year).

## Escalation

- If behavior violates platform terms, we may escalate to **GitHub Support/Trust & Safety**.  
- If credible threats of harm are involved, we may contact relevant authorities.
